Breathe Easy EDA (BEEDA) is a simple but flexible toolbox for Electrodermal Activity (EDA)
data management, cleaning, and analysis. This software was specifically designed to 
facilitate the methodical considerations of psychophysiology researchers. BEEDA enables 
users to eliminate EDA respiration artifacts and analyze EDA data using tonic and phasic 
EDA metrics, following from standard methodological implementations. The toolbox is 
suitable for any experiment recording both EDA and respiration data, and flexibly adjusts 
to experiment-specific parameters (e.g., trial structure and analysis parameters).
